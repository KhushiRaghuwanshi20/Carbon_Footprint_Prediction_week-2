# Week 2: Model Training & Prediction

## Project: Personal Carbon Footprint Predictor

In this week, I trained the AI model using the dataset I prepared in Week 1.

### What's in this repository?
prediction.ipynb: This is the main notebook file where I did all the coding. It contains the steps for:
  1. Loading the cleaned data from Week 1.
  2. Splitting the data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) parts.
  3. Training a **Linear Regression** model.
  4. Checking how accurate the model is.

### Results
My model performed really well on the test data.
Accuracy (R2 Score): ~98.4%
Conclusion: The model learned the patterns successfully and can now accurately predict the carbon footprint.
